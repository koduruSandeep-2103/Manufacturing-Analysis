## MANUFACTURING-ANALYSIS:

This project focuses on analyzing key manufacturing KPIs such as Manufactured Quantity, Rejected Quantity, Processed Quantity, 
and Wastage Quantity to understand overall production performance. It also includes deeper analysis like employee-wise and machine-wise 
rejected quantity to identify whether defects are caused by specific workers or faulty machines. Trends such as month-wise production 
comparison and Manufacture vs Rejected patterns help in understanding productivity changes over time. Additionally, department-wise
manufacturing vs rejection analysis highlights which departments perform efficiently and which ones need improvement. Overall, 
these metrics give stakeholders a complete picture of production quality, efficiency, problem areas, and opportunities for cost 
reduction and process improvement.

## TOOLS USED: Excel, Tableau , Mysql, Power bi

## STEP BY STEP WORKFLOW: 

•	Excel Dashboard: Create an initial dashboard using provided Excel data.

•	SQL Integration: Load files into a SQL database under a manufacturing data schema.

•	BI Tool Connection: Connect SQL database to Tableau/Power BI and create a data model with necessary joins.

•	Dashboard Development: Build interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI.

•	Quality Assurance (QA): Validate data by comparing database records with dashboards to ensure accuracy.

## MANUFACTURING - ANALYSIS KPI DESCRIPTION:

Manufacture Qty - Total number of units produced by the factory.
Rejected Qty - Units that failed quality checks.
Processed Qty - Total items that went through the production process.
Wastage Qty - Units wasted or damaged during production.
Employee Wise Rejected Qty - Rejected units linked to each employee.
Machine Wise Rejected Qty - Rejected units caused by each machine.
Production Comparison Trend - Shows how production changes over time.
Manufacture Vs Rejected - Comparison between total produced units and rejected units.
Department Wise Manufacture Vs Rejected -Production vs rejection performance for each department.
Emp Wise Rejected Qty - Same as employee-wise rejected units (repeated KPI).

## PROJECT PROCESS:

Data Collection & Import : Collected raw manufacturing datasets including production logs, machine performance data, quality inspection reports, 
and employee shift information. Imported the data into Excel, Power BI, and Tableau for processing and visualization.

Data Cleaning & Preparation :Removed duplicate production records, handled missing values, and standardized data formats across departments.
Created calculated fields such as Manufactured Quantity, Rejected Quantity, Processed Output, Wastage %, Machine Efficiency, and Employee-wise
Rejection Rate for deeper analysis.

Data Analysis : Performed production trend analysis, machine-wise performance evaluation, and department-wise quality assessment. 
Identified key metrics like production efficiency, rejection ratio, wastage percentage, machine downtime impact, and employee-wise productivity.

Dashboard Development : Developed interactive dashboards in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau displaying KPIs such as Manufactured Qty, Rejected Qty, 
Processed Qty, Wastage Qty, Employee-wise Rejected Qty, Machine-wise Rejected Qty, and Production Comparison Trends. Added filters for department,
machine, shift, product type, and employee.

Visualization & Insights Extraction : Visualized monthly production trends, machine performance variations, and department-wise rejection patterns. 
Extracted insights highlighting high-performing machines, low-wastage processes, employee quality impact, and areas of production bottlenecks.

Conclusion & Reporting :
Summarized findings showing consistent production levels, opportunities to reduce rejections, and chances to optimize specific machines and processes.
Presented insights through a comprehensive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making in the manufacturing environment.

## CONCLUSION:

This project provides a clear and data-driven view of the overall manufacturing performance by tracking key KPIs such as Manufactured Quantity,
Rejected Quantity, Processed Quantity, and Wastage. By analysing employee-wise and machine-wise rejections, the project helps identify the exact
sources of defects and improve operational efficiency. The Production Comparison Trend and Manufacture vs Rejected dashboards give management an
easy way to monitor quality performance over time. Overall, this project enables better decision-making, reduces rejection and wastage, improves 
productivity, and supports continuous improvement in the manufacturing process.
